# Case Studies Repo

The purpose of this repository is that it consists of different case 
studies presented in 
Comp 541 (Data Mining) at Cal State Northridge. 


### Case Study #1 : U.S. Educational Finances
The United States educational finance dataset
contains financial data for the education system
in the United States (1992-2016).Within the us-educational-financial.ipynb, 
we explore the educational funding between Bill Clinton, George  W. Bush, 
and Barack Obama. We also look at the relationship between 
the different variables in the dataset which include information on 
revenue and expenditure for each state and year, 
as well as details on funding sources
 and expenditures by category.

### Case Study #2 : COVID-19 Open Research Dataset 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 9 Open Research Dataset 
(CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 1,000,000 scholarly articles, including over 400,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. Given the large number of literature and the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is difficult for health professionals to keep up with new information on the virus. Can clustering similar research articles together simplify the search for related publications? Credits to https://github.com/MaksimEkin/COVID19-Literature-Clustering

### Case Study 3: Asteroid Diameter Prediction
Can AI algorithms in case of astronomy? Yes, if there is enough data. Utilizing a dataset 
maintained by Jet Propulsion Laboratory of California Institute of Technology which is an organization 
under NASA, one can solve the problem to predict asteroid. Within this notebook we try and build a basic
random forest regression model to predict the diameter of an asteroid.

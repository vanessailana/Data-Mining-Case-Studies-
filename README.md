# Case Studies Repo

The purpose of this repository is that it consists of different case 
studies presented in 
Comp 541 (Data Mining) at Cal State Northridge. 


### Case Study #1 : U.S. Educational Finances
The United States educational finance dataset
contains financial data for the education system
in the United States (1992-2016).Within the us-educational-financial.ipynb, 
we explore the educational funding between Bill Clinton, George  W. Bush, 
and Barack Obama. We also look at the relationship between 
the different variables in the dataset which include information on 
revenue and expenditure for each state and year, 
as well as details on funding sources
 and expenditures by category.
